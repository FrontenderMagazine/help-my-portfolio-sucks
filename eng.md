Dear My,

Everybody does some work they’re not proud of. Paula Scher and Jony Ive have
had the occasional project that didn’t work out as hoped. Dieter Rams may have a
thing he worked on that he cringes to think about today. Even Ethan Marcotte has
some fixed-width, bandwidth-intensive sites on his resume. When I worked in 
advertising, creatives at lousy shops took shoddy delight in finding out about 
dull, bread-and-butter accounts the award-winners occasionally had to work on. 
We all do it. It’s part of making a living. Sometimes you just need a gig, so 
you take on a project for which you can deliver competence, but nothing more. 
Other times, you take on a job with high hopes—only to have those hopes dashed 
because you couldn’t sell your best idea to the client, or because the business 
was better served by a dull solution than by the groundbreaking one you hoped to
put in your portfolio.

I learned a thing or two about how to gracefully handle less-than-stellar
projects from a friend who co-founded one of the leading boutique design 
consultancies of our age. At one time, this consultancy scooped up every 
challenging, high-profile strategic gig out there. After they delivered a 
handful of brilliant strategic bullet points for three-quarters of the client’s 
budget, my studio would come in—like the guys with brushes who follow the circus
elephants—and do all the design, user experience, and front- and back-end coding
work for what remained of the budget. Needless to say, I paid attention to how 
my highly paid strategist friends handled their business. (Rule Number One: don’
t hate successful competitors; learn from them.
)

At one point my illustrious friends took on a design project helmed by another
pal of mine, who was working at the client company. Let’s just say this one didn
’t go as well as hoped. For one thing, my friend who was working on the client 
side redid their code and design work, which is something a client should never,
ever, ever, ever do—and should never feel she has to do. The results were not 
pretty, and did not in any way reflect the client’s fond hopes or the consulting
studio’s work or philosophy.

So what did the consultants do when the project went live? Instead of featuring
the gig in their portfolio, they had their team leader write about the project 
in their blog. Rather than the work they had done, he discussed the business 
challenges the client had faced, and explained their strategic approach to 
solving those problems. The team leader was extremely complimentary (and 
rightfully so) about the client’s place in its sphere of business. He spoke 
warmly of the client’s openness to bold ideas. There was no hint of 
disappointment, and there was also no dishonesty. My friend wrote about the 
things that had attracted his team to the gig, and left everyone with a nice, 
warm, vague feeling. And that’s how you handle a job that doesn’t work out to 
your satisfaction.

We’ve done the same thing at [Happy Cog][4] once or twice, when the work we
delivered—although it satisfied the client and did everything it was supposed to
do—just wasn’t exciting enough to merit a portfolio showcase. So you write about
the business challenges you solved. Or about some innovative coding you did. Or 
you just share how honored you were to work on behalf of a client who does such 
wonderful things in the world. (I’m assuming you’re not ashamed of your client, 
even if you weren’t able to reach new design heights on their project.
)

But there’s another part to your question—or, at least, I have a question
about your question. It sounds like you’re not just unhappy with one or two 
projects you’ve worked on. It sounds like you’re unhappy with most of them.

Now, that would be another problem entirely. As a designer, it’s not just
your job to create something great. It’s also your job to sell that solution to 
the client. If you can’t do that, then you need to workshop your persuasion 
skills, just as you would workshop your CSS skills if they had gotten rusty. A 
designer must sell. That’s part of the work. A decent designer who can sell will
have a better career—and do better work—than a brilliant designer who cannot. 
There are books out there that can help.[Design Is a Job][5] is a great one. A
List Apart’s [Rachel Andrew][6] writes about the business of web development,
and Mike Monteiro’s[13 Ways Designers Screw Up Client Presentations][7] may
help you stop doing things in presentations that unconsciously undercut your 
work and convince the client not to buy your best ideas.

If deep-seated personality issues prevent you from selling—and you should
only come to that conclusion after working at least a year to improve your 
selling ability—then find a partner who is good at it. They’re probably good at 
business development, too, and will almost certainly justify the percentage you 
pay them by improving your professional profile, finding you better clients, and
helping you raise your pitifully low rates. (Designers who can’t sell always 
undercharge for their services. I know. I used to be one.
)

Countries and cultures factor in here, as well. There are some places in the
world where the designer is always wrong, and the client is a dictator. That is 
changing everywhere, but change comes slowly in some places, and you may not 
want to be the evangelist who single-handedly fights to improve the position of 
all designers in your part of the world. If you live in such a place, consider 
moving, or find a way to raise your profile so that you can work remotely for a 
more enlightened class of client.

Regardless of where you live, one important way to build a great portfolio is
to work on open source or community-based projects. Side projects like
[Fonts In Use][8] can build a designer’s reputation when the work she does
for clients is less than satisfactory. I have never hired a designer who doesn’t
have at least one interesting non-client project to show for herself, and I 
never will. When all else fails, create a killer blog. I startedA List Apart
because there was no magazine that approached web design the way I felt it 
should be approached, and to show what I could do when my first clients weren’t 
letting me do my best work.

I’ll have more to say about side projects in a future installment of “Ask
Dr. Web.
